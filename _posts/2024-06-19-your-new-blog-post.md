## First lesson; PINN is kinda an ode solver!

A multi-layer perceptron is essentially a complex nonlinear function. The complexity and nonlinearity depend on the number of neurons and layers. It can map \( \mathbb{R}^n \) to \( \mathbb{R}^m \), where \( m, n \in \mathbb{R} \).




 ```python
 import numpy as np
 A = np.array([3, 2])
 ```
