In this blog, you'll find a mix of in-depth tutorials, research insights, and practical applications of PINN, from the basics to more advanced topics.
My research mainly focuses on the intersection of Dynamical Systems and Neural Networks. Here, I delve into the fascinating world where these two fields converge.
This blog primarily offers tutorials from scratch on implementing topics related to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
